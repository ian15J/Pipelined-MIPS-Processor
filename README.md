# Pipelined MIPS Processor
Project code for pipelined MIPS processor.

## General Info
This project is for the Iowa State University CprE 381 course taken Fall of 2021.
This code simulates a pipelined processor using VHDL. Most of the code is adapted from the single cycle implementation of the processor. The Sw files are the pipelined processor where the hazards are fixed by adding nops in software. The Hw files is the processor where the hazards are fixed using hardware stalls, and forwarding.

## Technologies 
The technologies used in this project are:
* VHDL
* Assembly
